# ðŸ’« About Me:
Hi there! I'm a passionate fullstack developer with a strong interest in building secure, privacy-focused applications, blockchain projects, and personal AI systems. I enjoy working on creative solutions that blend ethical tech with real-world impact. I'm currently exploring GoLang, HTMX, and cyber security best practises such as AES-256 encryption and CSRF tokens. Always learning, always building.
